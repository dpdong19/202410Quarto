## Hands-on: Your first Quarto Project

### Instructions

1.  Click on `New Project`–\> `New Directory` -\> `Quarto Project` to create a new Quarto Project.

    ![](/images/new-project.PNG){width="500"}

    This will initiate a new project space with 3 files: `_quarto.yml`, `my-quarto-project.qmd` and `my-quarto-project.Rproj` (file name will be the same as what you typed earlier on).

    `my-quarto-project.qmd` is automatically open, and this is your first Quarto document!

2.  **Update YAML header**: title, author, date and set format to html `format: html`

3.  **Familiarize yourself with the `Visual editor` and the `Source editor`** - What's the difference?

4.  Add some headings

5.  Add some text in bold or italics.

6.  Render the document using the `Render` button.

## Hands-on: Markdown Basics

### Instructions:

1.  Add some **numbered list** and **non-numbered list**, using the *visual editor.* Switch back to the *markdown editor* and take note of the syntax. Try creating lists using codes as well.

2.  Add a piece of text and **hyperlink** it to a URL.

3.  Insert the **image** of a cat cafe into your report. The path to the image is `cat-cafe.jpg`

    ::: callout-tip
    Hint: Use the syntax `![caption](path_to_image)`. For example, `![Elephant](elephant.png)`
    :::

4.  Render the document to see the output.

Feel free to make use of this sample report and try recreating it in your First Quarto Document!

### Research Question

Do cats prefer window seats or cozy corners in cat cafés?

### Data Collection

We observed 50 cats in 5 different cat cafés. We recorded:

- Cat's choice of spot (window or corner)

- Cat's age (young, adult, senior)

- Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)

### Analysis

#### Creating a bar chart
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

# Create a simple pie chart
cat_spots <- c(window = 30, corner = 20)
pie(cat_spots, main="Cat's Favorite Spots")

```
