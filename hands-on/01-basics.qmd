## Sample Report

Feel free to make use of this sample report and try recreating it in your First Quarto Document!

#### Research Question

Do cats prefer window seats or cozy corners in cat cafés?

#### Data Collection

We observed 50 cats in 5 different cat cafés. We recorded:

\- Cat's choice of spot (window or corner)

\- Cat's age (young, adult, senior)

\- Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)

#### Analysis

```{r}

# Create a simple pie chart
cat_spots <- c(window = 30, corner = 20)
pie(cat_spots, main="Cat's Favorite Spots")

```
